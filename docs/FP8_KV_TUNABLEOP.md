# FP8-KV calibration and persisted TunableOp

This continuation adds two independent, opt-in workflows for dual gfx1201
systems. Neither changes the qualified default. FP8-KV calibration targets
attention fidelity; persisted TunableOp targets any residual rocBLAS/
hipBLASLt GEMMs not already served by Radiance's MXFP4, FP8, R4D, or fused
kernels.

The workflows deliberately do not replace Radiance's DFlash fused-KV
construction. The existing identity-through-the-quantized-projection path is
the compatibility-first implementation and remains unchanged.

The feature selection was informed by the public behavior documented for
[`tcclaviger/vllm`](https://hub.docker.com/r/tcclaviger/vllm). The
implementation here is independent: its image did not expose a corresponding
licensed source tree to transplant. TunableOp orchestration follows the
[official PyTorch offline-tuning contract](https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/aten/src/ATen/cuda/tunable/README.md),
and FP8-KV capture uses vLLM's public worker-extension and module-hook APIs.

## Safety contract

- The source model is never modified.
- Calibration outputs are new safetensors sidecars plus checksum/model-bound
  manifests. Existing output names are refused.
- Runtime loading accepts only positive scalar `q_scale`, `k_scale`,
  `v_scale`, and `prob_scale` tensors. Arbitrary checkpoint tensors are
  forbidden.
- Sidecars are loaded only when `RADIANCE_FP8_KV_SCALES` is explicitly set.
  Checksum and source-checkpoint verification are on by default.
- TunableOp is off by default. Collection records signatures but never tunes
  in live traffic. Actual tuning is a separate GPU maintenance command.
- Tuned results are checksum-verified and runtime tuning remains disabled in
  serving mode. PyTorch's own CSV validators additionally reject mismatched
  PyTorch, ROCm, hipBLASLt, and rocBLAS stacks.

## FP8-KV calibration

vLLM v0.28 no longer exposes the older one-shot `calc_kv_scales` path. The
Radiance calibrator instead installs a documented vLLM worker extension and
public PyTorch forward-pre-hooks on each full-attention layer. An eager run
observes the BF16 Q/K/V tensors immediately before attention, accumulates one
device scalar per tensor/layer without per-step CPU synchronization, then
reduces maxima across TP ranks.

The default artifact uses OCP E4M3's maximum magnitude 448 with 5% headroom:

```text
scale = observed_absolute_max * 1.05 / 448
```

Softmax probability is mathematically bounded by one, so `prob_scale` uses
`1.05 / 448`. On ROCm's FNUZ representation, vLLM performs its existing
checkpoint-scale conversion during load. The important target values for R4D
are K and V; Q/prob scales also make the artifact safe for supported fallback
attention paths.

Run this only after production has been stopped and the GPUs have been released:

```bash
docker run --rm --ipc=host \
  --device=/dev/kfd --device=/dev/dri \
  -e HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 \
  -e RADIANCE_MXFP4=1 \
  -e RADIANCE_MXFP4_W4A8=1 \
  -e RADIANCE_MXFP4_W4A8_MIN_M=0 \
  -v /path/to/models:/models:ro \
  -v /path/to/calibration-output:/calibration:rw \
  -v "$PWD/benchmarks/fixtures:/fixtures:ro" \
  --entrypoint python \
  magiccodingman/vllm-radiance:TAG \
  -m radiance_kv_calibration calibrate \
  --model /models/Qwen3.8-27B-Quark-AWQ-MXFP4-amd \
  --quantization auto \
  --corpus /fixtures/fp8-kv-calibration.jsonl \
  --output /calibration/qwen38-mxfp4-fp8kv-YYYYMMDD.safetensors \
  --tensor-parallel-size 2 \
  --max-model-len 16384 \
  --batch-size 4 \
  --seed 17
```

The JSONL format accepts either `text` or chat-template `messages`, optional
`tools`, and a bounded `repeat` multiplier. The checked-in corpus covers
agent/tool structure, code, reasoning, multilingual text, structured data,
and longer retrieval inputs. A deployment should extend it with representative
licensed/private traffic and retain a disjoint held-out correctness corpus.
Changing even a fine-tune can change activation ranges; calibrate each exact
target checkpoint rather than reusing scales by architecture name.

Verify without starting vLLM:

```bash
docker run --rm \
  -v /path/to/models:/models:ro \
  -v /path/to/calibration-output:/calibration:ro \
  --entrypoint python magiccodingman/vllm-radiance:TAG \
  -m radiance_kv_calibration verify \
  /calibration/qwen38-mxfp4-fp8kv-YYYYMMDD.safetensors \
  --model /models/Qwen3.8-27B-Quark-AWQ-MXFP4-amd
```

Enable it in a private `.env`/Compose override:

```dotenv
RADIANCE_FP8_KV_SCALES=/calibration/qwen38-mxfp4-fp8kv-YYYYMMDD.safetensors
RADIANCE_FP8_KV_SCALES_VERIFY=1
```

Mount the artifact and its sibling `.manifest.json` read-only at that path.
Never make `VERIFY=0` a deployment setting; it exists only to isolate an
intentional mismatch during diagnosis.

Qualification must compare default-scale and calibrated-scale runs with the
same image, target/drafter, prompts, seeds, sampling, graphs, and concurrency.
Required gates are meaningful fixed-prompt greedy output, sampled tool schema,
long-context retrieval, vision inputs when vision is deployed, BetterBench,
DFlash acceptance by category, and sustained c1/c2/c4/c8. Calibration is not a
TPS claim: expected direct throughput change is approximately neutral. Its
success criterion is better or unchanged fidelity, with DFlash acceptance an
important possible secondary effect.

## Persisted TunableOp

This uses PyTorch's standard two-stage offline workflow rather than tuning
inside model loading or production requests.

### 1. Collect signatures

Choose a fresh, explicit namespace and start the candidate with:

```dotenv
RADIANCE_TUNABLEOP_MODE=collect
RADIANCE_TUNABLEOP_CACHE_DIR=/cache/tunableop
RADIANCE_TUNABLEOP_NAMESPACE=IMAGE-PIN-MODEL-PROFILE-YYYYMMDD
```

The entrypoint exports:

```text
PYTORCH_TUNABLEOP_ENABLED=1
PYTORCH_TUNABLEOP_TUNING=0
PYTORCH_TUNABLEOP_RECORD_UNTUNED=1
```

Run the normal warmup plus representative prefill/decode concurrency shapes.
Stop the process gracefully so PyTorch writes `untuned0.csv`,
`untuned1.csv`, and any current results. No candidate timing is valid yet.

### 2. Tune offline

With production stopped and both GPUs free, run the same image and cache mount:

```bash
docker run --rm --ipc=host \
  --device=/dev/kfd --device=/dev/dri \
  -e HIP_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 \
  -e RADIANCE_VERSION=IMAGE_VERSION \
  -v /path/to/cache:/cache:rw \
  --entrypoint python magiccodingman/vllm-radiance:TAG \
  -m radiance_tunableop tune \
  --root /cache/tunableop/IMAGE-PIN-MODEL-PROFILE-YYYYMMDD \
  --input-pattern 'untuned?.csv' \
  --num-gpus 2 \
  --numerical-check 1e-3_1e-3
```

PyTorch deduplicates the signatures, distributes them over the visible GPUs,
and writes per-device results. Radiance then hashes every non-empty
`results*.csv` into `manifest.json`. The namespace should be treated as
immutable after qualification. The command enables PyTorch's candidate
numerical check at BF16-appropriate `atol=rtol=1e-3`; tighten or loosen it only
as a separately labeled experiment. PyTorch's standard 30 ms / 100-iteration
tuning bounds and L2-sized rotating buffer remain the defaults.

### 3. Serve from verified results

```dotenv
RADIANCE_TUNABLEOP_MODE=serve
RADIANCE_TUNABLEOP_CACHE_DIR=/cache/tunableop
RADIANCE_TUNABLEOP_NAMESPACE=IMAGE-PIN-MODEL-PROFILE-YYYYMMDD
```

Startup refuses a missing/tampered manifest, absent per-GPU results, or a
different Radiance/PyTorch version. PyTorch runtime tuning remains disabled.
Benchmark `serve` against `off`; promote it only if repeated quick/standard
runs show a real improvement and all correctness gates pass. Because the
qualified MXFP4 path already bypasses BLAS for most large projections, the
expected gain is modest and could be zero.

## Preflight and GPU qualification status

CPU-only validation covers parsability, sidecar restrictions, exact
checkpoint binding, tamper rejection, TunableOp result completeness, and
tamper rejection:

```bash
python benchmarks/bin/check_fp8_kv_calibration.py
python benchmarks/bin/check_tunableop.py
```

GPU calibration, sidecar load/scale inspection, full gates, TunableOp
collection/tuning, and performance comparisons are intentionally deferred
until a declared maintenance window.
